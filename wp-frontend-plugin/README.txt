v 2.5

Missing endpoint implemented: /chat/clear (your WP widget referenced it).
Monthly caps truly safe: caps enforced on every AI call; usage persisted immediately; BYOK honored.
BYOK + per-tenant limits: header x-api-key and optional x-ai-limit supported; plans still define defaults.
FAQs hot-reload: update faqs.json without restarting; supports "trigger": "text" or {pattern, flags}.
OpenAI call robustness: handles output_text, timeouts, non-OK responses gracefully; env model override.
Data directory: DATA_DIR for Render persistent disk; usage & FAQs saved there.
Small niceties: returns plan in /chat response; optional reset=usage query on /chat/clear.


v2.6 

Widget minimize/maximize
New launcher button #chatbot-launcher (bottom-right).
Chat window #chatbot-container starts hidden.
Clicking the header or the launcher toggles visibility.
State stored in localStorage (chatbot_widget_state).
Analytics: Usage by User
New table “Usage by User (this month)” that aggregates logs and displays:
User ID, Plan, latest AI Calls, and Last Seen.
No backend changes required; uses /analytics only.



v 2.6.3

Changes made:

Fix the minimize button on the chat widget.
Removed the header badge (“Pro (AI included)”) entirely.
Footer note now reads: “Powered by Nubedy” and links to https://www.nubedy.com/chat
Kept the usage bar behavior (no “(Usage: x/y)” inside messages).
Analytics now includes:
Per-user Plan, Limit, and Remaining columns (using the most recent log entry that includes a limit).
A compact Bot Status summary card on top (users, total calls, average limit).
Raw logs table shows the Limit field per event when available.
If your /analytics endpoint doesn’t currently include a limit property in each log, I left it resilient — it will show “-” for limit/remaining. If you want, I can update the backend to include limit in each analytics log entry so this UI is always populated.


V 2.7:


Changes made:

Frontend now pulls Backend URL, Tenant ID, and Plan from WP Settings (no hard-coded values).
Frontend sends the required x-tenant-id header to ground answers to the right site.
New Settings & Indexing page lets you:
Save settings (Backend/Tenant/Base/MaxPages/Plan).
Trigger Index Now and Check Status against your backend.
Upload CSV/JSON product feeds and list stored products.
Analytics page uses the configured Backend URL and shows Plan/Limit/Remaining.


V 2.8.0

Not big updates. Just alignment with the backend side. 


V2.9.2

What changed

Backend 2.9.2:
Friendlier, sales-oriented system prompt (still strictly grounded).
Auto-appends a “You may like:” block with up to 3 product bullets using markdown links [Name](URL) + optional price.
Expanded product intent triggers a bit (gift, category words).
Health/version bumped to 2.9.2.

Frontend 2.9.2:
Safe link rendering in chat bubbles:
Supports [label](https://link) and plain https://link.
Escapes all other HTML.
Launcher circle stays visible while the chat is open and toggles icon (open/minimize).
Theme & bot name settings remain (color applies to header + buttons).

Upload products. How it behaves now
Manual “Sync Woo ➜ Backend”: exports products filtered by your settings (categories, only visible, only in stock), compares hashes, and uploads only changed ones.
Nightly Auto-sync: same logic, runs daily (~02:15) if enabled.
On Save Auto-sync: single-product push, only if changed.
REST Preview (/wp-json/chatbot/v1/products?limit=10): shows the changed products that would be uploaded with your current filters.

Filters:
Categories: add slugs like rings,necklaces in Settings.
Only visible: includes products with catalog visibility not hidden.
Only in stock: excludes products that WooCommerce reports as out of stock.
Published only is enforced.



V 2.9.3

What’s new in v2.9.3 (plugin)

Woo pagination bug fixed: wc_get_products([ 'paginate' => true ]) is now handled as an array (['products','total','max_num_pages']), so products load correctly.
Woo ➜ Chatbot Products (Admin):
Preview (first N) — quick sample of what would be uploaded.
Sync Woo ➜ Backend — incremental (only changed products); respects filters.
Force full upload — uploads all matching products regardless of previous sync hashes (re-embeds everything on the backend; useful after bulk edits, theme/taxonomy changes, or embeddings model updates). A short help text is shown next to the button.
Filters supported (UI + REST):
Category slugs (comma-separated)
Only visible (exclude hidden)
Only in stock
Only published products are considered.
All prior features are preserved: floating widget, theming, analytics, site indexing, CSV/JSON product upload tools.
